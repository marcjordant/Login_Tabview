# Login_Tabview example

This sample project contains an example of how to create an NativeScript with Angular app that first displays a login page then a Tabview page, using the new possibilities of NativeScript 4.0, as explain by [Sebastian Witalec here](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/structuring-your-pages-sidedrawers-and-tabviews-with-nativescript-4.0)

In this blog, there is a small talk about the possibility to use a login page before the Tabview page, but this is not very clear.
(in the section `app.routing.ts - (other example)`)

This example project contains the code to demostrate that.
